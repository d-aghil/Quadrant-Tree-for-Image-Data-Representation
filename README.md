# Quadrant Tree for Image Data Representation

High-Performance Quadtree Data Structure for Spatial Partitioning and Image Processing

This repository contains a robust and scalable Java implementation of a Quadtree ‚Äî a highly efficient hierarchical data structure widely used in computer graphics, image compression, spatial indexing, and collision detection.

 Key Highlights:
		‚Ä¢	Optimized for spatial data retrieval with logarithmic-time complexity for quadrant access
	‚Ä¢	Implements memory-efficient node management to reduce overhead
	‚Ä¢	Suitable for real-time systems, game development, and geospatial applications
	‚Ä¢	Built using object-oriented design principles and follows clean code standards

Project Structure
	‚Ä¢	QTreeNode.java:
Encapsulates the core node structure of the quadtree with features like:
	‚Ä¢	Immutable coordinate system and spatial metadata
	‚Ä¢	Lazy instantiation for child nodes, enhancing memory efficiency
	‚Ä¢	Encapsulation of color data for pixel-based image compression
	‚Ä¢	QuadrantTree.java:
Provides the quadtree construction logic with capabilities to:
	‚Ä¢	Recursively build a balanced quadtree from pixel arrays
	‚Ä¢	Traverse and retrieve nodes at various hierarchical levels
	‚Ä¢	Optimize spatial searches through depth-first and breadth-first traversal methods

Getting Started

Prerequisites
	‚Ä¢	Java 8 or higher
	‚Ä¢	IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or CLI tools for compilation

üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Execution

# Compile the source code
javac QTreeNode.java QuadrantTree.java

# Run the program (with your main driver file)
java Main

üíª Sample Code Usage

int[][] pixelData = {
    {255, 255, 0, 0},
    {255, 255, 0, 0},
    {0, 0, 255, 255},
    {0, 0, 255, 255}
};

QuadrantTree qt = new QuadrantTree(pixelData);
QTreeNode root = qt.getRoot();
System.out.println("Root Node Color: " + root.getColor());
